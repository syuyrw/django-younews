# Overview

I created this app as the base for a project that has been floating around in my head for years. The original idea was to make a news app, but all of the news stories are created by the users. It would be location based like YikYak where you can only see the stories that are within a set distance from where you currently are.

This app is the very basic beginning of that app idea. I ran out of time to flush it out further. I was able to create a web app that enables you to create a admin account with a username and password, make additional user, follow and unfollow users, and view other user profiles, all from an interactive GUI.

Eventually I would like to continue to build out this app not only because I want to learn more about Django, but also because I think that the app is a good idea.

# Web Pages

There are currently three pages for this app. There is the admin account where you can add, remove, and change users of the site. You can change who is following who, and see posts that have been posted by each user.

The second page is a list of all of the profiles. On this page you can see all of the profiles on the site, and when you click on one of the profiles in the list, it will take you to the third page, which is the profile page.

Each profile page displays various information about each of the users. You can view who each user is following from their profile page as well as click on the username of the person they are following to view their profile page.

# Development Environment

I used a virtual development environment for this project with Python, HTML, and Django.

I also used an imported library to handle the css for me called Bulma.
